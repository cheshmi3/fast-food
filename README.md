# Data-Scientist-case
large food retailer and have received sales data on clients and the products they purchase from the marketing department. They want your help to analyse the data and provide key recommendations that will guide their marketing strategy.


#Dataset:
The dataset contains 392 766 monthly sales records from 2015 to April 2020. Each record contains information on the total amount purchased by a client for a specific product during the month (if the client purchased several products, this will lead to multiple records for the same month). Each record also includes information relating to the type and location of the client and the sector they operate in. A mapping file in Excel is provided.


#Task:
My task is to analyze the data using methods and software of your choice and prepare a brief presentation with the key findings to the marketing department. The task is divided into two parts:
Part 1: perform EDA of the data and visualize key patterns and/or recent trends of the type of clients or products sold.
